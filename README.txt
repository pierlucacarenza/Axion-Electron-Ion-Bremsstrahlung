AXION-ELECTRON BREMSSTRAHLUNG

This table can be used to compute the axion emissivity for electron-ion bremsstrahlung 
in a Red Giant core, using the complete matrix element including finite axion mass and 
any electron degeneracy.

If you use this table, please cite the following paper:

Carenza Lucente "Revisiting axion-electron bremsstrahlung emission rates in astrophysical environments"

********************************************
The entries of the table are:

 eta	    ma/T	me/T	ks/T	    ris 	     err

where eta is the electron degeneracy parameter; T is the temperature in keV; ma is the axion mass in keV;
me is the electron mass in keV; ks is the screening scale in keV; ris is the function I (see Eq. 10 of Ref. [1]);
err is the relative error calculated by the D01GDF NAG routine

for more details. In order to obtain the axion emissivity the function in the table must 
be used as in Eq. 10 of Ref. [1].
