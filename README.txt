AXION-ELECTRON BREMSSTRAHLUNG

These tables can be used to compute the axion emissivity for electron-ion bremsstrahlung 
in a Red Giant core, using the complete matrix element including finite axion mass and 
any electron degeneracy.

If you use these tables, please cite the following paper:

P.~Carenza and G.~Lucente,
``Revisiting axion-electron bremsstrahlung emission rates in astrophysical environments,''
[arXiv:2104.09524 [hep-ph]].

********************************************
Extract the 10 tables from the rar archives.

The entries of the tables are:

 eta	    ma/T	me/T	ks/T	    ris 	     err

where eta is the electron degeneracy parameter; T is the temperature in keV; ma is the axion mass in keV;
me is the electron mass in keV; ks is the screening scale in keV; ris is the function I (see Eq. (10) of Ref. [1]);
err is the relative error calculated by the D01GDF NAG routine, see Ref. [2] for more details. 

Each table contains a different range of eta as follows:

1 - [-1, 4]
2 - [4, 9]
3 - [9, 14]
4 - [14, 19]
5 - [19, 24]
6 - [24, 29]
7 - [29, 34]
8 - [34, 39]
9 - [39, 44]
10 - [44, 49]

In order to obtain the axion emissivity the function in the table must 
be used as in Eq. (10) of Ref. [1].
